# Lab07 - Cos-distance

This is the README for Lab07 - Cos-distance. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Usage

To run Main file in Lab07, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
     g++ main_double_vector.cpp multidimension_double_vector.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
To run Unit Test file in Lab07, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unittests_multidimension_double_vector.cpp multidimension_double_vector.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the implementations.
