# Lab02 - Fisher-Yates Algorithm

This is the README for Lab02 - Fisher-Yates Algorithm. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The Fisher-Yates Algorithm Lab provides an implementation of the Fisher-Yates algorithm along with unit tests to verify its correctness with the help of functions implemented in Lab01.

## Usage

To run Lab02, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 -I. unit_tests_fisher_yates.cpp fisher_yates.cpp prefix_sum.cpp -o unit_tests
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./unit_tests
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the Fisher-Yates algorithm implementation.
