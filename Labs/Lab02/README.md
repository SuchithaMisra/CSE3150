# Lab02 - Fisher-Yates Algorithm

This is the README for Lab02 - Fisher-Yates Algorithm. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The Fisher-Yates Algorithm Lab provides an implementation of the Fisher-Yates algorithm along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Lab02, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_tests_fisher_yates.cpp fisher_yates.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the Fisher-Yates algorithm implementation.
