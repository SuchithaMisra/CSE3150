# Lab01 - Prefix Sum

This is the README for Lab01 - Prefix Sum. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The Prefix Sum Lab provides an implementation of the prefix sum algorithm along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Lab01, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_tests_prefix_sum.cpp prefix_sum.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the prefix sum implementation.
