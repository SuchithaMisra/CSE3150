# Lab03 - Pointer jumping exercise

This is the README for Lab03 - Pointer jumping exercise. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The Pointer jumping exercise provides an implementation of jumping pointers and unit tests to verify its correctness with helper functions implemented.

## Usage

To run Lab03, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ UnitTest.cpp linked_list.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the Pointer jumping exercise implementation.
