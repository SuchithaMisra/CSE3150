# Lab05 Exercise 

This is the README for Lab05. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Usage

To run Main file in Lab05, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ logic_matrix_main.cpp logic_matrix.cpp read.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
To run Unit Test file in Lab05, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unittests.cpp logic_matrix.cpp read.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the implementations.
