# Exercise06 - Week 8

This is the README for Week 8. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The weeks exercise provides an implementation that reads in vectors, doubles in 2D, and computes all pairwise cosine distances for all vectors and outputs pairs of vectors â€“ ordered by the cosine closeness of the vectors along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Unit Tests in Exercise06, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_tests_double_vector.cpp double_vector.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

To run Main file in Exercise06, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ double_vector_main.cpp double_vector.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
   
This will run the main file and unit tests for the implementation.
