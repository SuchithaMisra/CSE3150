# Exercise05 - Week 7: Lambdas

This is the README for Exercise05 - Lambdas. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The Lambdas exercise provides an implementation of how to compute a perfect number and output it along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Unit Tests in Exercise05, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 unit_tests_lambda.cpp -o unit_tests_lambda
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./unit_tests_lambda
    ```

To run Main file in Exercise05, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 lambda_main.cpp -o lambda_main
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./lambda_main
    ```
   //Prompted to enter an integer to run through the function
   
This will run the main file and unit tests for the perfect number implementation.
