# Exercise03 - Week 5: Good Design and Structs

This is the README for Exercise03 - Good Design and Structs. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The Good Design and Structs exercise provides an implementation of how to compute student's total class score and output it along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Unit Tests in Exercise03, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_tests_student.cpp student.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

To run Main file in Exercise03, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ student_main.cpp student.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the main file and unit tests for the class_total_score implementation.
