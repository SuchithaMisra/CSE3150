# Exercise02 - STL starter

This is the README for Exercise02 - STL starter. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The STL starter exercise provides an implementation of both stack and queue operations along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Exercise02, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_test.cpp Stack_Queue_Operations.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the unit tests for the Stack_Queue_Operations implementations.
