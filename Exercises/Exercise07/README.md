# Exercise07 - Week 9 - Area of a triangle with 3D points

This is the README for Week 9. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The weeks exercise provides an implementation that computes the area of a triangle with 3d points using the Heronâ€™s formula along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Unit Tests in Exercise07, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_test.cpp Point3d.cpp Triangle3d.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

To run Main file in Exercise07, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ main_triangle.cpp Point3d.cpp Triangle3d.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
   
This will run the main file and unit tests for the implementation.
