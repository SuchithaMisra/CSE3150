# Exercise08 - Week 10 - Hybrid vehicles

This is the README for Week 10. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The weeks exercise provides an implementation to solve the diamond problem using virtual inheritence/OOP along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Unit Tests in Exercise08, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unittests.cpp Vehicle.cpp Electric.cpp Gasoline.cpp Hybrid.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

To run Main file in Exercise08, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp Vehicle.cpp Electric.cpp Gasoline.cpp Hybrid.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
   
This will run the main file and unit tests for the implementation.
