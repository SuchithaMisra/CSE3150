# Exercise04 - Week 6: STL vectors

This is the README for # Exercise04 - STL vectors. It contains information about how to build and run the code.

## Introduction

The STL vectors exercise provides an implementation of how to read two dimensional vectors in from a file and output the reverse version along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To run Unit Tests in Exercise04, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ unit_tests_vector.cpp int_vector.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

To run Main file in Exercise04, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ int_vector_main.cpp int_vector.cpp
    ```

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

This will run the main file and unit tests for the implementation.
